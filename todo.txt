X -consider alternatives:
    _ -stick w/ jupyter magic(s), pretty errors, debugger, etc.
        UPDATE: these sound useful too but I do like the hotkey popup box UI.
    _ -subclass ipython kernel (can this be loaded in jupyter? Probably)
        UPDATE: promising for long term programming redesign. Not as useful for short term idea.
-set up simple server extension
    X -create endpoint that returns the input but uppercased (or something like that)
    X -get endpoint to render in browser (cur results in page not found)
        UPDATE: moved jupyter load func to init.py, removed leading underscore, ran jupyter w/ extra flag, added jupyter serverextension install line to makefile.
    -figure out how to call endpoint from main.js
		UPDATE: tutorial uses jupytper typescript module. Having trouble figuring out the js equivalent.
    ~ -update endpoint to call codex
		UPDATE: get request works with curl and "repeat" backend. Would be nice to get post working (don't love the idea of passing all vars in url) but so far getting auth errors there).
-further investigate possibility of enabling post request instead of get in handlers.py
-brainstorm more possibilities for solving the issue of connecting frontend ext and server ext (e.g. see if we can transpile to typescript, use codex to translate to typescript, search more for js examples, try codex translating typescript example to requirejs, ask question on stackoverflow, comment on jupytercon youtube vid, etc.) and consider how to proceed
-figure out how to access most recently run cell. Useful if we don't want to include whole nb in query.
-bug: input_prompt (thing in brackets next to cell) is an incremented number instead of "User" after running (Note: may be better to figure out how to use a text cell, which doesn't have number prompts. But the text cell wasn't rendering at all.)
    UPDATE: cell.output_area.handle_output() may be promising for updating code cell output without executing. Hold off for now though - prob a good idea to change to a text cell if possible. Jupyter seems to think my dict is undefined - maybe expects a different type?
-bug: shift+enter no longer working in scratchpad (NOT duckling)
